	<!--(Ingredients Start)-->
		<ul>
			<li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small pieces</li>
			<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water</li>

			<li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt; pulse to combine. Add the butter, and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pieces remaining, about 10 seconds. (To mix by hand, combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, then cut in butter with a pastry blender.)</li>
			<li>With the machine running, add the ice water through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream, just until the dough holds together without being wet or sticky. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Test by squeezing a small amount of the dough together; if it is still too crumbly, add a bit more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
			<li>Turn out the dough onto a clean work surface. Divide in half, and place each half on a piece of plastic wrap. Shape into flattened disks. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.</li>
